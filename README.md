To build this website yourself, 

Download the code from Github found here.

Create a Google Drive folder with the name of your website. Create different subfolders for the different pages on the website. (home, resources, mesh-map, etc.)

Within each folder, create a Google Doc. Press: File > Share > Publish to Web > Embed and save the link. Input these links into the HTML code from Github. The code will designate where to put these links.

Within each map folder, create a Google Forms. Press: File > Share > Publish to Web > Embed and save the link. Input these links into the HTML code from Github. The code will designate where to put these links.

In the Google Forms, press “Link to Sheets” in the “Respones” page. In the Sheets, Press: File > Share > Publish to Web > CSV and save the link. Input these links into the Javascript code from Github. The code will designate where to put these links.

Format the Google Sheets just like how they are on our website. 

Using notepad or an IDE, review each page (index.html, resources.html, etc.) and go through the previous steps and make sure to match each link to its respective Google docs, Sheets, and Form. The downloaded code will tell you where to put these links.

Publish your website for free using Netlify or another provider.

Share your finished website to others to continue growing the project!
